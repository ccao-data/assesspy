AssessPy is a software package for Python developed by the Cook County Assessorâ€™s (CCAO)
Data Department. It contains many of the functions necessary to perform a standard
[sales ratio study](https://www.iaao.org/wp-content/uploads/Standard_on_Ratio_Studies.pdf).

For assessors, we believe that this package will reduce the complexity of calculating
ratio statistics and detecting sales chasing. We also hope that reporters, taxpayers,
and members of academia will find this package helpful in monitoring the performance
of local assessors and conducting research.

For detailed documentation on included functions and data, [**visit the
full reference list**](https://ccao-data.github.io/assesspy/reference.html).

For examples of specific tasks you can complete with `assesspy`
functions, see the [**vignettes page**](https://ccao-data.github.io/assesspy/vignettes.html).
