    "# Sales ratio study with real data\n",
    "\n",
    "AssessPy can easily be used with various data to conduct a sales ratio study. In this vignette, we demonstrate this process using real data from the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO). The CCAO publishes assessments and sales on the [Cook County Open Data Portal](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/stories/s/i22y-9sd2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics of sales ratio studies\n",
    "\n",
    "A sales ratio is the ratio of the assessor's estimate of a property's value to the sale price of a property. A sales ratio study is a report on how accurately and fairly an assessor predicted property values. The CCAO has a [rigorous set of rules](https://gitlab.com/groups/ccao-data-science---modeling/-/wikis/SOPs/Sales%20Ratio%20Studies) that govern how sales ratios studies are conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are four important statistics produced in sales ratio studies, listed in the table below. It is important to understand that these statistics are calculated based on properties that sell. In most jurisdictions, the number of properties that sell in any single year is a very small percentage of the overall number of properties. In order to characterize the quality of the assessment role in a jurisdiction, we draw an inference from this small number of properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Statistic               | Acceptable Range | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                                             |\n",

    "### Interpretation of sales ratio statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a jurisdiction with a median ratio of one and a COD of 20. This indicates that, on average, the assessor predicts the sale price of properties accurately, but with a high dispersion. To use the dart board analogy, the assessor's darts fall in a wide area centered around the bullseye. On the other hand, if the median ratio is greater than one, and the COD is lower than 10, this indicates that the assessor consistently over-estimates the value of properties in their jurisdiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a jurisdiction with a low COD and high PRD & PRB. This indicates that the assessor consistently under-estimates higher value properties, and over-estimates lower value properties. Properties of similar value receive similar estimates, but there is structural inequality in the overall system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, suppose you have a jurisdiction with CODs, PRDs, and PRBs all within the acceptable range, but there is strong evidence of selective appraisals. In this case, the sales value statistics should be disregarded, since they are based on a non-random selection of the underlying set of properties. They cannot be used to characterize the quality of the assessment role.\n",
